diff
   strips away exact match lines so focus is on differences, which are potentially errors.
access to old versions:
   ability to revert for comparison
   follow development progress.

pros and cons of manual commit
   con:
      too long between commits can risk loss of info
   pros
      restricting commits to meaningful releases makes them more useful

why do some non-git systems not support multiple file repository/commits?
     they are not meant for a interdependents system of files.

how to use git log and git diff to view file history
      use git log to find the commit of interest id (if it has been helpfully annotated)
      use git diff to see the changes from the previous commit

with change control, if changes break something, reverting back is easier.

I plan to use git to track python scripts for larger projects
