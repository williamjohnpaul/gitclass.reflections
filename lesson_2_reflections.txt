after git init, a .git directory appears to keep the git status.
no commits have been done, so the status reflects that.
any (noncommitted) files in the directory are reflected as that in the status


staging area is part of the working directory - files that have been designated by the git add command as pending a commit

using git add and git commit as each logical change is best practice. 
having a definition of "logical change" may be difficult.

branches are useful when a change is not ready to be introduced into the main branch - e.g., I want to experiment with it or it is just an early thought

the graph view of branches shows that which commits are in the history of a particular branch and how much change has been since the last branch

merging to the current branch adds the changes from the merged branch to the branch. 
This might not result in good code if the changes conflict logicallly

automatic merge might save time for simple changes, manual merge could likely result in better, more efficient code if there is overlap of changes.
